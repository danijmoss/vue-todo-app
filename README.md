# VueJS ToDo App

The obligatory To Do app every developer ends up making when learning a new language/framework/etc.

This is the first project for the Udemy course [Fun Projects with Vue 2](https://www.udemy.com/fun-projects-with-vue-2/) by Packt Publishing.

This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) project and is made using VueJS 2, Bootstrap 4, jQuery, and Font Awesome 5.
